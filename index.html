         <p>
        I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know that unfortunately, 
        I won't be able to make it to the 6 PM meeting today. 
        I'm currently tied up with responsibilities at my internship, 
        and I won't be able to make it home until around 7 PM. 
        I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. 
        Is there a possibility to reschedule the meeting or catch up on what I missed afterward?

        Thank you for understanding.
        Stephen Okex
